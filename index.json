    "keywords": "DashDashVersion DashDashVersion creates predictable and opinionated SemVer 2.0.0 version numbers for git flow repositories. It consists of an executable that can be installed as a dotnet global tool and a reusable library NET Standard 2.0 that can be used in other applications or .NET based build scripts. Installation DashDashVersion can be installed as a dotnet global tool by using the following command: $ dotnet tool install --global git-flow-version or the library part can be added as a package using: $ dotnet add package DashDashVersion Usage To use DashDashVersion run the command git-flow-version inside a git repository. It will return a JSON string with the following properties: SemVer = a SemVer 2.0.0 compliant version number without metadata FullSemVer = a SemVer 2.0.0 compliant version number with build metadata AssemblyVersion = an AssemblyVersionAttribute compatible version with the format <major>.<minor>.<patch>.<revison> For example: $ git-flow-version {\"FullSemVer\":\"0.2.0-dev.1+8af6c6d\",\"SemVer\":\"0.2.0-dev.1\",\"AssemblyVersion\":\"0.2.0.128\"} Requirements DashDashVersion only supports repositories that strictly follow the git flow conventions with the branch names: master develop release/<major>.<minor>.<patch> feature/<feature name> hotfix/<major>.<minor>.<patch> support/<support branch name> this may seem overly restrictive but we believe strongly in simplicity and convention over configuration. Bootstrap requirements A tag on master with a SemVer 2.0.0 compliant name for the latest release, without a pre-release label and without build metadata, even if it's only a 0.0.0 at the beginning of the master branch. On any active release/ or hotfix/ branch add a tag using the <major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.<number> format if having consecutive rc versions is required. Configuration There is nothing to configure ðŸ™Œ, you have already done the necessary configuration by adhering to git flow ðŸ˜œ. Keep in mind Only release/ , hotfix/ , develop and feature/ branches are supported, for other branches a human has to decide on a version number. Make sure to tag release and hotfix branches after generating a version number, the next version number is solely reliant upon that tag. For unsupported branches if a tag is already present in the correct format, that version number will be returned, to facilitate rebuilds on master for example. What version number to expect On develop The number of commits since the last release version <major>.<minor>.<patch> is used for the numeric part of the pre-release label. Since the content of develop will be in the next version of your project, the <minor> version number will be 1 higher than the <minor> number of the last release version. For example if there are 3 commits on develop and the last tag on master is 0.0.0 the version number will be 0.1.0-dev.3 . After performing: $ git flow release start 0.1.0 $ git flow release finish the output of git-flow-version will be: {\"FullSemVer\":\"0.2.0-dev.1+8af6c6d\",\"SemVer\":\"0.2.0-dev.1\",\"AssemblyVersion\":\"0.2.0.128\"} On a feature/ branch For a feature branch a version number will be calculated for the branch-off point from origin/develop or develop if there is no origin/develop . The number of commits on the feature branch is counted and these pieces are glued together. For example with a feature named featureA with 5 commits since branching from origin/develop with version number 0.1.0-dev.12 the calculated version number would be 0.1.0-dev.12.featureA.5 . If a second feature is started from the feature/featureA branch named featureB the number of commits since branching from origin/develop will be used, so the version number would be 0.1.0-dev.12-featureB.6 , if only a single commit is made on branch featureB . On a release/ branch Release candidates use a simple +1 strategy, if the release/0.2.0 branch has just been created and has no commits yet, the version number will be 0.2.0-rc.1 . If there exists a tag on the release branch that has the form 0.2.0-rc.<a=highest rc number> the calculated version number will be 0.2.0-rc.<a+1> . So if the last tag was 0.2.0-rc.4 the next version number would be 0.2.0-rc.5 . On master The version number of the tag on HEAD will be returned if it can be found and parsed otherwise an error is generated.
